								<h2>A little bit about my academic path…</h2>
								<p>I am an international student at Baruch College, Zicklin School of Business, in New York. My major is Computer Information Systems, general track. As for my current area of interest, I am most drawn to data science and the architecture of tech solutions, and would like to continue developing my skillset in this direction. Here are a few examples of my academic and extracurricular projects:</p>
								<ol>
									<strong><li>2022 Baruch Data Challenge with Pitney Bowes</li></strong>
									<br /><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/natalia-kurbakova/Baruch-Data-Challenge/blob/00d2a7f29f9d9b87423b030e097ec514bc018927/Data%20Challenge%204-28-22.ipynb">Link to Github repository</a> <br />
									Contributors: Lola Rustamova, Zi Zeng, Natalia Kurbakova.</blockquote>
										<ul>
											<li>Visualized relationships between 17 fields in the exploratory data analysis and feature significance.</li>
											<li>Cleaned 40500 records containing missing values, manipulated the type of derived data.</li>
											<li>Researched and evaluated 3 prediction models utilizing ML packages Scikit-learn and XGBoost.</li>
											<li>Incorporated the Decision Tree model template with the most effective parameters, increasing the accuracy of the final model to 81%.</li>
										</ul>
									<strong><li>Systems Analysis and Design course project</li></strong>
									<br /><blockquote>Contributors: Sebastian Miezgiel, Natalia Kurbakova</blockquote>
										<ul>
											<li>Applied Agile/ Scrum methodology to project management in Microsoft Azure DevOps.</li>
											<li>Gathered requirements by formulating 25 user stories and interviewing stakeholders.</li>
											<li>Communicated 4 project deliverables to the stakeholders throughout the duration of the project and presented UML diagrams describing the design of the CRM software solution.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>
								<h2>A little bit about my professional development…</h2>
								<p>Throughout June 2022, I had the pleasure to participate in a nation-wide work prep hosted by Accenture and Girls Who Code, where I learned invaluable advice about approaching new projects and challenges and developing a growth mindset. Accenture’s professionals shared resources to help succeed in a technical career and discussed the importance of accountability to personal goals.<br />
								<br />In addition to that, I am currently pursuing a DataCamp certification for data science with Python – one of my personal goals I want to keep myself accountable for.</p>
								<h2>Next steps…</h2>
								<p>Since I am graduating in Spring 2023, I have completed most of the required CIS courses with a 3.7 GPA. For the two upcoming semesters, I am planning to focus on my Business Analysis minor for my Zicklin Undergraduate Honors Program. I am also excited to complete the “Language and Social Interaction” capstone for my second minor – Communication Studies. This leaves me with more time for my social life at my university:<br />
								<br /><em>To get the most out of my college experience in the U.S., I want to contribute to social clubs at Baruch College!</em> <br />In particular, I want to join the <strong>Association for Information Systems</strong> club and the <strong>International Student Organization</strong>, as it will be the most impactful next step towards expanding my network of like-minded peers.</p>
